# csgoserverthingy
A little webinterface that allows you to manage a CS:GO server's config files and cvars, as well as execute some commands.

I doubt anyone else will be interested in this, so this will be the bare minimum documentation. If you do for whatever reason feel like you want to use this, feel free to message me!

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/Nimos/csgoserverthingy.git`  
`npm install`  
open `run.js` and change the attributes of the settings object  

## Running
`node run.js`
